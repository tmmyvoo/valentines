<h6> hello trung, I know this isn't much but you told me you wanted a coupon for valentine's day so I made you one! Since we won't be able to spend the time together I hope we can do something over the phone and just have fun togteher! I've been trying to code this website for a few days now and now that I've figured it out I'm happy to share my first (project) with you! I just wanna tell you how I muuuuch love you and how much you actually mean to me, I hope you like this small self-made present just as much I do, I love you so so much and hope that we'll have a wonderful future together! Thank you for being the best, best boyfriend I could ever imagined of!  Thank you for bein there for me when I needed u the most, and thank you for loving me and not giving up on me. I love you! - Tommy</h6>
